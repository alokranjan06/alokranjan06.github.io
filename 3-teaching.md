   <p class="ex2" align="justify"> This course focuses on state and local public finance primarily through the lens of applied microeconomics.
The aim of the course is to provide an understanding of the role of sub-national government in provision of
public goods and their revenue and expenditure choices under fiscal federalism. This course will introduce
students to the topics of public choice, demand and provision of government goods with a particular emphasis
on the structure of revenue instruments of state and local governments including property, sales, income and
business taxation and their efficiency and equity considerations. The course explores both the theoretical
framework of local public finance as well as empirical evidence related to these theories. </p>

   <p class="ex2" align="justify"> This course is primarily designed for advanced undergraduate students. This course introduces students to
the field of labor economics. We will cover models and evidence on the supply, demand, and market for
labor, then topics such as education, immigration, discrimination and unemployment. We will study how
individuals decide how much to work, how firms decide how much labor to hire, and how these demand and
supply forces play out in the equilibrium. We will also study how workers decide on education levels, how
they decide where to locate, and the role of discrimination in labor markets. The course concludes with a
discussion of labor market institutions and future of work. </p>

<p class="ex2" align="justify"> <em>The instructor always pushed the students to do their best, and communicated his ideas in a very efficient
and effective manner. One of the few courses I’ve taken where the instructor is actually passionate about
the subject matter and I feel that really helped my understanding of the material and increased the effort
I put into the class </em> </p>

<p class="ex2" align="justify"> <em> Very enthusiastic teaching absolutely loved the way he taught the class. Always had an example to put
something into context to make it easier to understand. Was always available to help was extremely helpful
during office hours. Was willing to change things to make the course more helpful such as moving one
set of office hour time from Wednesday to Friday because it made it much easier for us to come to him
with questions about our assignments which were given to us on Wednesday. Absolutely loved everything
about the class no complaints </em> </p>
