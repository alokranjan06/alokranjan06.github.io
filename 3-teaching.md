<!--   <p class="ex2" align="justify"> <em> Course description: </em> This course centers on the subject of state and local public finance, primarily viewed through the applied microeconomics approach. Its main objective is to foster comprehension of how sub-national governments play a role in providing public goods.

Through this course, students will be introduced to various topics, including public choice, the demand and provision of government goods, and with special focus on the revenue structures employed by state and local governments. These structures encompass property, sales, income, and business taxation, and are analyzed for their efficiency and equity considerations. Both the theoretical framework of local public finance and the empirical evidence related to these theories will be covered in the course. </p> -->

The curriculum covers various topics, including models and evidence related to labor supply, demand, and market dynamics. Additionally, we will delve into areas such as education, immigration, discrimination, and unemployment. Throughout the course, we will explore how individuals make decisions about their work hours, how firms determine their labor force size, and how these factors interact to establish equilibrium in the labor market. Moreover, we will examine the decision-making processes of workers regarding their education levels and location choices, as well as the role of discrimination in labor markets. The course concludes by discussing labor market institutions and providing insights into the future of work. </p> -->

<hr>
<p class="ex2" align="justify" > <em>The instructor always pushed the students to do their best, and communicated his ideas in a very efficient
and effective manner. One of the few courses I’ve taken where the instructor is actually passionate about
the subject matter and I feel that really helped my understanding of the material and increased the effort
I put into the class </em> </p>

<p class="ex2" align="justify"> <em> Very enthusiastic teaching absolutely loved the way he taught the class. Always had an example to put
something into context to make it easier to understand. Was always available to help was extremely helpful
during office hours. Was willing to change things to make the course more helpful such as moving one
set of office hour time from Wednesday to Friday because it made it much easier for us to come to him
with questions about our assignments which were given to us on Wednesday. Absolutely loved everything
about the class no complaints </em> </p>

<p class="ex2" align="justify"> <em> The instructor did a good job on explaining the course concept and is very easy to approach. He
is patient and willing to help student achieve learning goals. The assignments he designed are
well-linked to the learning materials. The questions are not easy but he always encourage students
to dig deeper. This is one of the best courses I took! </em> </p>


<p class="ex2" align="justify"> <em> Super patient and responsible - Passionate toward teaching and the field - his approachable
and friendly personality make students easier to ask questions - Ability to give clear and logical response related to the course </em> </p>


<p class="ex2" align="justify"> <em> The presentations made by the TA were really helpful and organized. He explained the concepts
in the course really clearly and coherently. I liked that he would use a lot of pictures and examples
to explain the ideas summarized on the slides. I also appreciated that he made sure that we didn’t have any questions before moving on to a new topic.  </em> </p>

<p class="ex2" align="justify"> <em>  The teacher of this course always took feedback from the students and was very flexible regarding
what content he focused on. I enjoyed all of the topics that we talked about in class and thought that the powerpoints, quizzes, and homeworks really helped reinforce the concepts we talked about
in class. I also enjoyed how the professor gave real-life examples of a lot of the theoretical concepts we talked about. I also found all of the outside papers and podcasts he gave us very interesting.  </em> </p>
